ADFS Server
Spin up a VM using Windows Server 2022

vboxuser
changeme

https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration <---gitlab will use
https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx <--- to test

192.168.1.50    adfs.adfs.local <--- Manually resolve this in etc/hosts> <--- since we host the static ip>

Set-AdfsProperties -EnableIdpInitiatedSignonPage $true <--- use powershell when you install adfs>


üõ† Step-by-Step: Setup ADFS in a Single Windows Server 2022 VM
1Ô∏è‚É£ Set a Static IP (important for AD & ADFS)

Inside your VM, open Control Panel ‚Üí Network and Internet ‚Üí Network Connections.

Right-click your active network adapter ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) ‚Üí click Properties.

Choose Use the following IP address and fill in something like:

IP address: 192.168.1.50 (something in your LAN/VM range)

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Default gateway: your router IP (e.g. 192.168.1.1)

Preferred DNS server: same as IP (192.168.1.50, once we install AD DS)

Click OK and close.

üëâ This makes your server reachable with a fixed IP.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Rename the Server

Open Server Manager (should start automatically).

Click Local Server (left sidebar).

Find Computer name ‚Üí click the blue link ‚Üí change it to ADFS-SERVER.

Reboot the VM when prompted.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Open Server Manager.

Click Manage ‚Üí Add Roles and Features.

Keep clicking Next until you reach Server Roles.

Check Active Directory Domain Services ‚Üí Click Add Features ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Install.

When finished, click the yellow triangle at the top ‚Üí Promote this server to a domain controller.

Select Add a new forest, name it adfs.local.

Set a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password (write it down).

Keep defaults ‚Üí Install ‚Üí VM will reboot.

üëâ Now this VM is a Domain Controller.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Domain User (for testing login later)

Open Start ‚Üí Windows Administrative Tools ‚Üí Active Directory Users and Computers.

Expand your domain adfs.local.

Right-click Users ‚Üí New ‚Üí User.

Example:

User logon name: testuser

Password: Password123! (disable password change if you want for lab)

Finish.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Install ADFS Role

Open Server Manager ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Add Roles and Features.

Next ‚Üí choose Active Directory Federation Services.

Add Features ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Install.

After install, click Configure the federation service.

Select Create the first federation server in a federation farm.

Choose your domain admin account (the one you used to log in, e.g., Administrator@adfs.local).

Certificate: For lab, you can generate a self-signed cert:

Open PowerShell as Admin and run:

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "adfs.adfs.local" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"


Use that certificate in the wizard.

Federation Service Name ‚Üí adfs.adfs.local.

Service account ‚Üí use the built-in domain admin for now.

Complete wizard ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Reboot if required.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Verify ADFS is Running

Open browser inside VM.

Visit:

https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx


If it loads a login page, ADFS is working üéâ

Login with testuser@adfs.local / Password123!.

7Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) OIDC Test

Open browser:

https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration


Should return JSON with endpoints (authorization, token, jwks).

This is the URL GitLab will use later.



üîπ Step 1: Create an Application Group in ADFS

Open AD FS Management ‚Üí Application Groups ‚Üí Add Application Group.

Choose a template:

For GitLab OIDC, select Server application accessing a web API ‚Üí Next.

Name your group: e.g., GitLab OIDC Test.

Add a Server Application:

Client Identifier: gitlab-client or can use the given guid

Redirect URI: https://gitlab.local/users/auth/openid_connect/callback

Click Next.

Configure Client Secret:

ADFS generates one ‚Üí you‚Äôll copy it into GitLab.

Review ‚Üí Finish.

Now ADFS knows about GitLab as a client that can request OIDC tokens.

üîπ Step 2: Configure GitLab

In GitLab (gitlab.rb or Admin ‚Üí OIDC provider), add:

gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  {
    "name" => "openid_connect",
    "label" => "ADFS",
    "args" => {
      "name" => "openid_connect",
      "scope" => ["openid","profile","email"],
      "response_type" => "code",
      "issuer" => "https://adfs.example.com/adfs",
      "discovery" => true,
      "client_auth_method" => "query",
      "uid_field" => "sub",
      "client_id" => "<the GUID you copied>",
      "client_secret" => "<secret from ADFS>"
    }
  }
]

issuer: points to your ADFS domain (https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs)

client_id & client_secret: match what you configured in ADFS

redirect_uri: must match exactly the URI registered in ADFS

üîπ Step 3: Test Login

Go to GitLab login ‚Üí you should see ‚ÄúADFS‚Äù button.

Click it ‚Üí you get redirected to https://adfs.adfs.local/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx (or directly the login page).

Enter your domain user credentials (testuser@adfs.local).

GitLab should log you in using the token returned by ADFS.

üîπ Step 4: Troubleshooting Tips

If login fails ‚Üí check GitLab logs for OIDC errors.

Make sure redirect URI exactly matches what‚Äôs configured in ADFS.

For local lab/self-signed cert ‚Üí you may need to trust the cert in GitLab host.

If you want, I can make you a ready-to-use step-by-step guide from ‚ÄúI have JSON‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúGitLab login works with ADFS‚Äù, including screenshots for all settings.

Do you want me to do that?

# Pre requisite
1. Install dependencies
2. Set up folder structure
3. Set up a ADFS Server (Simple one use chatgpt)

# Folder Structure
ansible:
  - inventory
  - playbooks
  - roles:
      - pgsql
  - ansible.cfg
volumes
  - gitlab-data
      - config (Create this empty directory and wait for docker to mount the container to your host)
      - data (Create this empty directory and wait for docker to mount the container to your host)
      - logs (Create this empty directory and wait for docker to mount the container to your host)
  - gitlab-runner-config-data
  - nexus-data:
      - (Wait for docker to mount the container to your host)
  - nginx-data:
      - certs (You have to generate your own certs or place your signed certs and keys)

docker-compose.yaml (By doing docker compose up -d, you will spin up a gitlab server and a nexus server with a nginx server but please fulfil the dependencies for dev environment first)





#How to create your own SSL Cert


#NGINX-data, Add in your own certs and key. And also in your trust store, although it is self-sign hence it will still be insecure.


#NGINX configuration would be directly in the volume which mounts the
